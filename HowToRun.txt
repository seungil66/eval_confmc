1. Program FPGA
   - do not forget to setup Vivado environment.
   - do not forget to connect JTAG-USB and CON-FMC USB to the host computer.
   - do not forget to turn on the FPGA board.
   
   $ cd hw/download
   $ make

   - refer to TroubleShooting.txt if anything went wrong.

2. Check CON-FMC USB status
   - do not forget to press BTND of Nexys Video and RESET of CON-FMC
     after downloading bit-stream.

   $ lsusb

   Bus 002 Device 006: ID 04b4:00f3 Cypress Semiconductor Corp.
   ...

4. Run software
   - refer to TroubleShooting.txt if anything went wrong.

   $ cd sw/inference
   $ make
   $ make run

5. Check results
   - When everyting goes well, followings should be found in 'results' directory.
   - "predict_results.txt": all inference results in text.
   - "*_bb.png": image with bounding boxes.
   - "*_result.txt": inference results in text.
   - "*.dat": inference results in binary.

     example_test_mask_001_result.txt
     example_test_mask_002_bb.png
     example_test_mask_002.dat
     example_test_mask_002_result.txt
     ....
